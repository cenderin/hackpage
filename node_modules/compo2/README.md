#Compositive

Compositive is a web framework for Node.js, which can be used for both the most simple and the most advanced web projects.

* combines the advantages of PHP (simple file structure) with the advantages of Ruby on Rails (Convention over Configuration, MVC, DRY)
* adds another paradigm: Everything in one place (EIOP).
* ridiculously fast: server startup time: 5ms


Directory structure:
```
/app/
/config/
```

# Examples

## Hello world

```
/app/hello.jade
```


## A sample application

```
/app/root.jade          # template for '/'
    /_root.coffee       # controller for '/'
    /root.sass          # css for '/'
    /about/about.jade   # template for '/about'
