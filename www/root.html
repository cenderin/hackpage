  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Ahoy! My name is Sean Hagstrom and I am a Web Artisan.</p>
  <p>I love the web as a medium for building apps and displaying art.</p>
  <P>I'm inspired by open source and learning new languages.</P>
  <p>Concurrency is a new subject that I like to explore.</p>
  <p>I am also very passionate about Hypermedia APIs and API Design.</p>
  <p>I became a Developer over a year ago, and have transitioned from front end development to back end programming.</p>
  <p>Although I believe in learning the full stack, so I still have a growing interest in Client Devlelopment and UI/UX.</p>
