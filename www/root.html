      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hey im sean, this is my hackpage.
        <br>whats a hackpage you ask? a Hackpage is the word i use to define a work in progress website. A website meant for developers, or will be developers to start learning how to build a website for themselves, and go through the pains of not using tools like sass, or web frameworks to do it for you.
        <br>You would instead build on top of this hacky code and realize the pain the tools we use try to ease.
        <br>You would then try to slowly convert your code to better states using tools like sass or handlebar templates, or whatever.
